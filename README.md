✔️ Smooth character movement (left, right, jump)
✔️ Gravity and collision detection
✔️ Real-time rendering using the HTML5 Canvas API
✔️ Game loop with physics updates


🛠️ Technologies Used
    JavaScript (ES6) – Game logic and physics
    HTML5 Canvas API – Rendering graphics
    Event Listeners – Handling player input
    requestAnimationFrame() – Running the game loop

    ✍️ Reflection
What went well:
Creative Design: The Medival scene, player movement on both the run and jump, collectibles all blended well and potrayed the game well. despite not having a sprite, i was able to implement two pictures for two actions, one for moving and one to show when player jumps.
Core Mechanics: The dropping obstacles despite not having so much space to fall on, still came out well and surprisingly the gravity for boxes on the platforms and dropping obstacles turned out even better than i imagined.
Sound: sound was implemented and it was my first time making a game from the scratch and i was able to add the sound that i really liked.

Challenges:
Putting all my ideas to reality: i had a wide imagination for this and because i was unable to do them, i had to start small and that was tough because i had so  many conflicting ideas.
Bug Fixes: My codes at some point wernt working because i made some mistakes but it was fun after i fixed all the bugs.
So much youtube videos: i watched so many youtube videos and at some point it conflicted me and chat gpt even damaged my code more but all of these challanges made the experience funny eachtime i think about it.
Arranging my codes in different folders, and now i hav all my codes in the same file and each time i tried to to arrange it in different folders it scattered my game and developed bugs.


Lessons Learned:
Always seek for help from the tutors and teachers
Ensure to always have a json structure so as to know what your game is meant to be and look like before proceeding to make anything.
You can do anything if you set your mind, heart and resilliance towards it, also pray about everything because chatgpt can mess up your code and youtube can contradict somethings you have already in your code but God would not. lol
Keep it Simple: Focusing on one unique mechanic instead of multiple features made the game more polished.
